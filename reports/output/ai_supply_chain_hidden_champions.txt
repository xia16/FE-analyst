SECTION 1: SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT
================================================================================
These companies make the machines that make the chips. Without them, no AI chip
exists. Lead times for equipment are 12-24 months. Switching costs are extreme.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1  ASML Holding NV
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ticker:          ASML (NASDAQ / AMS: ASML)
Headquarters:    Veldhoven, Netherlands
Market Cap:      ~$270-350B (fluctuates significantly)
FY2024 Revenue:  ~EUR 28-30B

WHAT THEY MAKE / MOAT:
  - Sole manufacturer of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems
  - Each EUV machine costs $150-380M+ (High-NA EUV: $380M+)
  - Also dominant in Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) immersion lithography
  - Machines contain ~100,000 parts from ~5,000 suppliers
  - The light source alone (produced by subsidiary Cymer) is a miracle of
    engineering: tin droplets hit by laser 50,000x/second to produce 13.5nm light

MARKET POSITION:
  - 100% monopoly on EUV lithography (literally zero competitors)
  - ~90% share of advanced DUV immersion lithography
  - ~62% of total lithography market by revenue
  - Only 3 customers for EUV: TSMC, Samsung, Intel

WHY CRITICAL TO AI:
  - Every advanced AI chip (NVIDIA H100/B200, AMD MI300, Google TPU v5, etc.)
    REQUIRES EUV lithography at 7nm and below
  - No EUV = no advanced AI chips. Period. There is no alternative path.
  - High-NA EUV (0.55 NA) is required for sub-2nm nodes coming 2025-2027
  - TSMC alone accounts for ~30-40% of ASML's revenue

REVENUE EXPOSURE TO AI/SEMI: ~100% (pure-play semiconductor equipment)
AI-SPECIFIC EXPOSURE: ~40-50% (advanced logic = primarily AI/HPC driven)

SWITCHING COSTS: Infinite. There is no alternative supplier.

  - Near-monopoly in advanced node defect inspection

WHY CRITICAL TO AI:
  - At 3nm/2nm nodes, a single defect can kill a $30,000+ AI die
  - Yield is EVERYTHING for AI chip economics - KLA's tools determine
    whether fabs produce chips profitably
  - As features shrink, inspection becomes exponentially harder and more
    valuable - KLA's competitive moat WIDENS with each node
  - EUV mask inspection is a KLA near-monopoly and utterly essential

REVENUE EXPOSURE TO AI/SEMI: ~90%+ (pure-play semi equipment; small PCB biz)
AI-SPECIFIC EXPOSURE: ~35-45% (advanced logic + advanced DRAM for AI)

    for through-silicon vias (TSVs) and 3D stacking
  - Advanced packaging (CoWoS, etc.) is heavily etch-dependent
  - Every additional layer of 3D NAND = more Lam equipment needed
  - Gate-all-around (GAA) transistors at 2nm/below are etch-intensive
  - AI chip advanced packaging is a MASSIVE tailwind for Lam

    chip production - TSMC literally cannot make enough CoWoS capacity
  - Onto's tools inspect the packaging that assembles AI chip packages
  - As chiplet architectures grow, packaging inspection becomes more critical
  - HBM stacking quality control increasingly uses Onto equipment
  - Small company with outsized importance in the AI packaging bottleneck

REVENUE EXPOSURE TO AI/SEMI: ~100% (pure-play)
AI-SPECIFIC EXPOSURE: ~35-45% (heavily weighted to advanced packaging)

  - CMP slurries are consumable and node-specific = recurring revenue grows with
    each new node generation
  - AI chip fabs are the most advanced fabs = highest Entegris content per wafer
  - "Content per wafer" increases ~15-20% per node generation
  - Single contamination event can destroy millions of dollars of AI wafers

  - #4 in NAND (~11-13% share)
  - Only US-based major DRAM manufacturer

WHY CRITICAL TO AI:
  - HBM is THE memory technology for AI GPUs (NVIDIA H100/B200 use HBM3/3E)
  - Each H100 GPU uses 80GB of HBM; B200 uses 192GB - demand is insatiable
  - HBM has 3x+ the margin of standard DRAM
  - HBM supply is severely constrained - allocated years in advance
  - Micron is the ONLY Western HBM supplier (Samsung, SK Hynix are Korean)

  - MPS's integrated power modules are smaller, more efficient, and cooler
  - Design wins on NVIDIA GPU reference designs create enormous pull-through
  - As GPU power increases (300W -> 700W -> 1000W+), power delivery becomes
    more critical and more valuable
  - MPS has won significant share on next-gen AI GPU platforms

REVENUE EXPOSURE TO AI/SEMI: ~100% (pure semiconductor)
AI-SPECIFIC EXPOSURE: ~30-40% (enterprise data/AI server power = largest segment)

WHY CRITICAL TO AI:
  - AI data centers need efficient power conversion from grid to chip
  - SiC power devices reduce power losses in data center power supplies
  - EV charging infrastructure (to power AI data center adjacent campuses)
  - Less DIRECTLY critical to AI than other companies on this list
  - More of a power infrastructure / grid modernization play
  - Higher risk / reward profile: large capex, uncertain profitability timeline

REVENUE EXPOSURE TO AI/SEMI: ~100% (pure-play SiC semiconductor)
AI-SPECIFIC EXPOSURE: ~5-15% (indirect via power infrastructure efficiency)

SWITCHING COSTS: High for SiC substrates (limited qualified suppliers).

  - Universal Robots is #1 in collaborative robots (cobots)

WHY CRITICAL TO AI:
  - Every AI chip (GPU, TPU, custom ASIC) must be tested on ATE before shipping
  - HBM testing is a new, fast-growing segment (HBM3E is harder to test)
  - AI chips are the largest, most complex dies ever made - test time is long
  - Higher test costs per die = higher ATE revenue per die
  - Advanced packaging test (chiplet testing) is a new growth vector
  - Memory test demand surging as HBM production ramps

REVENUE EXPOSURE TO AI/SEMI: ~60% (semi test ~60%, robotics ~25%, other ~15%)
AI-SPECIFIC EXPOSURE: ~25-35% (AI chip test + HBM test)

  SK Hynix/Micron (HBM production) -> Lam (etch for TSVs) -> FormFactor
  (probe cards for HBM test) -> Teradyne (ATE for HBM test) -> Entegris
  (materials) -> AMAT (deposition for stacking)
  HBM is THE current production bottleneck for AI GPUs.

THEME 3: THE CUSTOM AI SILICON WAVE
  Broadcom + Marvell designing custom AI chips for hyperscalers
  Synopsys + Cadence providing the design tools
  This trend REDUCES dependence on NVIDIA but INCREASES demand for the
  entire semiconductor supply chain (more chip designs = more of everything)

THEME 4: POWER & COOLING CRISIS
  AI data centers consuming 50-100MW+ each
  Vertiv + Schneider + Eaton for power infrastructure
  Modine + Vertiv for liquid cooling
  Monolithic Power Systems for chip-level power delivery
  Power/cooling is the physical constraint on AI growth

THEME 5: NETWORKING FOR AI SCALE
  Arista (switches) + Broadcom (switching silicon) + Marvell (optics DSP)
  + Amphenol (connectors) = the nervous system of AI clusters
  800G -> 1.6T Ethernet transition is underway

RISKS TO MONITOR:
  - Semiconductor cycle: These companies are cyclical despite AI tailwind
  - China export controls: Impacts revenue for ASML, AMAT, LRCX, KLAC, etc.
  - Customer concentration: Many depend on TSMC, NVIDIA, or 2-3 hyperscalers
  - Valuation: Many trade at premium multiples; vulnerable to multiple compression
  - Technology shifts: New architectures (photonic computing, quantum) could
    eventually disrupt, but not in the next 5-10 years
  - Geopolitical risk: Taiwan (TSMC), South Korea (SK Hynix/Samsung) concentration
