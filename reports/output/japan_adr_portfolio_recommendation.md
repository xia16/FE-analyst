# Japanese AI Infrastructure ADR/OTC — Balanced Portfolio Recommendation
*Investment Research Report — 2026-02-10*

---

## Recommendation: **BUY (Selective, 7-Name OTC Portfolio + TSE Overlay)**

> The Japanese AI infrastructure supply chain contains some of the world's strongest competitive moats — monopolies and near-monopolies in semiconductor equipment, materials, and power infrastructure essential to the global AI buildout. This report synthesizes valuation, growth, balance sheet, risk, and liquidity analysis across 11 companies to deliver an actionable portfolio recommendation for USD-based investors.

**Key finding:** Only 7 of 11 companies are realistically tradeable via OTC ADR. The remaining 4 require Tokyo Stock Exchange direct access or ETF substitution.

## Executive Portfolio Summary

| Ticker | Company | Rating | Target Allocation | Rationale |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **HTHIY** | Hitachi | **STRONG BUY** | 18% | Best risk/reward: 40% below ATH, record results, power grid secular tailwind, Tier 1 liquidity |
| **SHECY** | Shin-Etsu Chemical | **BUY** | 12% | Fortress balance sheet (1.3T yen net cash), 17x fwd P/E at earnings trough, massive buyback |
| **ATEYY** | Advantest | **BUY** | 15% | Highest direct AI exposure, 30-40% forward growth, capacity-constrained. Risk: extreme valuation |
| **TOELY** | Tokyo Electron | **HOLD** | 12% | Solid quality but growth decelerating, PEG 3.1 signals limited upside from current levels |
| **HOCPY** | Hoya Corporation | **BUY** | 10% | EUV mask blank monopoly, fortress balance sheet, near ATH but quality justifies premium |
| **LSRCY** | Lasertec | **BUY** | 7% | Monopolist at cyclical trough, High-NA EUV catalyst ahead. Risk: governance overhang |
| **DSCSY** | Disco Corporation | **HOLD** | 6% | Exceptional moat and margins but 45x fwd P/E leaves no margin of safety |
| 7011.T | MHI (TSE direct) | **BUY** | 5% | 12T yen backlog, 7-year turbine wait times. **OTC (MHVYF) untradeable** |
| 4062.T | Ibiden (TSE direct) | **BUY** | 5% | PEG 0.9, 24% earnings CAGR, direct NVIDIA supplier. **OTC (IBIDF) untradeable** |
| 5802.T | Sumitomo Electric (TSE) | **HOLD** | 4% | Cheapest on every metric but low margins, indirect AI exposure. **OTC (SMTOY) untradeable** |
| 4004.T | Resonac (TSE direct) | **AVOID** | 0% | D/E 1.54, Altman Z 1.37 (distress), legacy chemical drag. **OTC (SHWDY) untradeable** |

**Total OTC allocation:** 80% | **TSE direct/ETF overlay:** 14% | **Cash reserve:** 6%

## I. Investment Thesis

The AI infrastructure buildout is a multi-year capital expenditure supercycle. Hyperscaler AI capex is projected at approximately $600B in 2026 (+36% YoY), with no plateau visible. Every AI chip — from NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs to HBM memory stacks — must pass through the supply chain bottlenecks controlled by these Japanese companies: wafers (Shin-Etsu), equipment (TEL, Advantest, Disco, Lasertec), mask blanks (Hoya), substrates (Ibiden), packaging materials (Resonac), power grids (Hitachi), turbines (MHI), and cables (Sumitomo Electric).

**Bull case:** AI capex continues accelerating through 2027-2028 as monetization proves out. Equipment revenue reaches $156B by 2027. Power infrastructure backlog extends further. Japanese yen strengthens 10-15% from PPP undervaluation, adding currency tailwind for USD investors.

**Bear case:** AI monetization disappoints, hyperscalers cut capex guidance in 2H 2026. Semiconductor equipment stocks de-rate 30-40% as the market prices cycle peak. China export controls remove 20-40% of addressable market for equipment makers.

## II. Detailed Company Ratings

### STRONG BUY: Hitachi (HTHIY) — 18% Allocation

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Forward P/E | 24x | Reasonable for 10%+ revenue growth |
| EV/EBITDA | 11.9x | Below Japanese industrial peer median |
| P/B | 1.8x | Lowest among growth names |
| PEG | 1.5 | Attractive |
| D/E | 0.24 | Net cash positive (+215B yen) |
| Revenue Growth | +10% YoY | Energy segment +33% in Q3 |
| Earnings Growth | +62% (H1) | Record profitability |
| Distance from ATH | **-40%** | Significant dislocation |

**Why STRONG BUY:** Hitachi is 40% below its February 2025 all-time high despite posting record results and raising guidance across all six KPIs. The Energy segment (+33% revenue growth) is the fastest-growing division, driven by transformer and HVDC backlogs filled through 2027+. Hitachi Energy is investing $9B globally ($1B in the US alone) in grid solutions — the largest investment in the power grid industry. The PEG of 1.5 with accelerating margins makes this the best risk/reward in the group. It is also the only Tier 1 liquid OTC name outside semiconductor equipment, making it the single most important portfolio diversifier.

**Key risks:** US tariff exposure (15% on Japanese imports), conglomerate complexity diluting the power grid narrative.

---

### BUY: Advantest (ATEYY) — 15% Allocation

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Forward P/E | 44x | Expensive, but 30-40% forward growth |
| EV/EBITDA | 42.0x | Premium to all peers |
| Operating Margin | 42% | Best-in-class |
| ROE | 48% | Exceptional capital efficiency |
| Revenue Growth | +26% (FY2025), guided +30-40% (FY2026) | Accelerating |
| Earnings Growth | +57% YoY | Explosive |
| D/E | 0.15 | Strong balance sheet |

**Why BUY:** Advantest is the single most direct AI beneficiary — every NVIDIA GPU, every HBM stack, every AI accelerator must be tested on Advantest equipment. HBM test times are 5-10x longer per device than standard DRAM, creating demand that scales faster than chip volumes. Guidance has been raised three times, with capacity expanding from 3,200 to 5,000 to 7,500 systems. Operating margin of 42% and ROE of 48% are best-in-class. If FY2027 growth of 30-40% materializes, the forward P/E drops to approximately 30-35x on FY2027 earnings.

**Key risks:** Extreme valuation (44x P/E), 0.93 correlation with NVIDIA, NVIDIA customer concentration, high-beta — fell 10.2% in a single session during the November 2025 AI selloff.

---

### BUY: Shin-Etsu Chemical (SHECY) — 12% Allocation

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Forward P/E | 17x | Cheap for the world's #1 wafer maker |
| EV/EBITDA | 9.1x | Well below sector median |
| P/B | 2.2x | Depressed by massive cash pile |
| Dividend Yield | 2.1% | Highest among quality names |
| D/E | 0.06 | Near-zero debt |
| Net Cash | +1,300B yen | **Strongest balance sheet in corporate Japan** |
| Current Ratio | 6.2x | Extreme liquidity |

**Why BUY:** 17x forward earnings for the world's dominant silicon wafer manufacturer with 1.3 trillion yen in net cash is genuinely reasonable value. Liquid assets exceed total liabilities by 1,120B yen. The 500B yen share buyback (10.2% of outstanding shares) is the largest in Japanese corporate history. Current earnings are at a cyclical trough — operating margin has compressed from 32% to 25-26% due to PVC weakness and wafer ASP pressure. When the wafer cycle inflects (expected FY2027-2028), significant earnings recovery should follow. This is a classic "quality at a reasonable price" with a fortress balance sheet providing downside protection.

**Key risks:** Sluggish near-term growth (~flat earnings), PVC segment (~40% of revenue) has zero AI exposure, wafer recovery timing uncertain.

---

### BUY: Hoya Corporation (HOCPY) — 10% Allocation

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Forward P/E | 28x | Premium, but monopoly justifies it |
| EV/EBITDA | 19.5x | Reasonable for 45% EBITDA margin |
| EBITDA Margin | 45% | Exceptional |
| D/E | 0.04 | Negligible debt |
| Net Cash | +497B yen | Fortress |
| Revenue Growth | +13.6% YoY | Solid |
| Q3 Net Income Growth | +81.4% YoY | Margin expansion |

**Why BUY:** Hoya dominates >75% of the EUV mask blank market and is the only validated vendor for High-NA EUV blanks. Every advanced AI chip manufactured at TSMC, Samsung, or Intel requires Hoya's mask blanks. The 45% EBITDA margin, near-zero debt, and structural EUV growth provide strong quality support. The Life Care segment (~50% of revenue) provides defensive earnings stability. The High-NA EUV transition (2nm node, volume production 2026-2027) is a medium-term catalyst requiring new, more expensive mask blanks.

**Key risks:** Emerging competition from Applied Materials, AGC, DuPont on EUV blanks (5+ year horizon), HDD glass substrate weakness, technology transition execution risk.

---

### BUY: Lasertec (LSRCY) — 7% Allocation

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Forward P/E | 17x | Optically cheap — **on trough earnings** |
| Normalized P/E | ~30-40x | Cyclically-adjusted, more representative |
| EV/EBITDA | 15.2x | Moderate for a monopolist |
| D/E | 0.07 | Minimal debt |
| Gross Margin | 59% | Strong pricing power |
| FY2026 Guidance | Revenue -12.5%, Profit -29% | **Cyclical trough** |

**Why BUY (contrarian):** Lasertec is the sole-source provider of actinic EUV mask inspection tools — a genuine monopoly in a critical process step. The forward P/E of 17x is misleading because it is calculated on trough-year earnings during a down cycle. On mid-cycle earnings, the stock trades at approximately 30-40x. The next upcycle catalyst is High-NA EUV, with orders expected to recover from CY2026 as volume manufacturing ramps at 2nm. The new ACTIS A300 tool targets High-NA EUV inspection specifically.

**Key risks:** Short-seller report (Scorpion Capital, 2024) created governance overhang. Lumpy revenue (ships ~20-30 tools/year globally). Competitive threat from ZEISS entering actinic inspection. The stock is 22% below its 52-week high.

### HOLD: Tokyo Electron (TOELY) — 12% Allocation

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Forward P/E | 26x | Moderate |
| EV/EBITDA | 20.1x | In-line with equipment peers |
| PEG | 3.1 | **Growth fully priced** |
| D/E | 0.00 | Zero debt |
| Net Cash | +455B yen | Fortress |
| Revenue Growth | +32.8% (FY2025), +6.9% guided (FY2026) | **Decelerating** |

**Why HOLD (not BUY):** Tokyo Electron is a high-quality equipment anchor — the world's #3 semiconductor equipment maker with zero debt and 455B yen net cash. However, the PEG of 3.1 indicates that current growth is fully priced into the valuation. Revenue growth is decelerating sharply from +32.8% to +6.9%. China revenue declining from ~42% to ~30% is a structural headwind. The company is pivoting toward AI-driven equipment (40% of sales target by FY2026), but at 26x forward earnings with decelerating growth, the risk/reward is balanced rather than compelling.

**Why not AVOID:** Fortress balance sheet, diversified product portfolio, Tier 1 OTC liquidity, and the 1.5% dividend yield provide downside support. Suitable as a core equipment anchor.

---

### HOLD: Disco Corporation (DSCSY) — 6% Allocation

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Forward P/E | 45x | Extremely expensive |
| EV/EBITDA | 34.0x | Richest in the group |
| P/S | 12.8x | Extraordinary premium |
| D/E | 0.00 | Zero debt |
| Gross Margin | 70% | Best-in-class, industry-leading |
| Operating Margin | 41% | Exceptional |

**Why HOLD (not BUY):** Disco's 70% gross margin, zero debt, and monopoly in precision dicing/grinding are extraordinary — "DISCO pricing" is literally an industry term. The company is a structural beneficiary of HBM stacking and advanced packaging. However, at 45x forward P/E and 12.8x P/S, there is zero margin of safety. Any margin disappointment or demand miss triggers disproportionate selloff at these multiples. The stock is better owned on pullbacks.

---

### BUY (TSE Direct): Ibiden (4062.T) — 5% Allocation

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Forward P/E | 18x | Attractive |
| EV/EBITDA | 7.9x | Modest for 24% earnings CAGR |
| **PEG** | **0.9** | **Most attractive growth-adjusted valuation** |
| Earnings CAGR (analyst) | 24% | Highest on the list |
| Revenue Growth | +10.5% (9M) | Solid |
| D/E | 0.58 | Moderate leverage |

**Why BUY (TSE only):** On a PEG basis (0.9), Ibiden is the most attractively valued name relative to growth. The company is a direct NVIDIA substrate supplier — every GPU shipped contains an Ibiden substrate. The 500B yen capex plan targets 2.5x production capacity by FY2027. Demand exceeds production capacity today, giving the company pricing power.

**Critical constraint:** The OTC ticker IBIDF trades approximately 151 shares per day — effectively untradeable. Must be accessed via TSE (4062.T) through an international brokerage.

**Key risks:** 500B yen capex will materially increase leverage, customer concentration (NVIDIA dependency), ABF resin supply bottleneck from Ajinomoto.

---

### BUY (TSE Direct): Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) — 5% Allocation

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Forward P/E | 58x | Extremely expensive |
| Order Backlog | >12T yen | 2.5x annual revenue |
| Gas Turbine Wait Time | 7 years | Unprecedented demand |
| Revenue Growth | +10% | Accelerating |
| Earnings Growth | +23% | Solid |

**Why BUY (TSE only):** The 12 trillion yen order backlog and 7-year gas turbine wait times are staggering. Data center power demand is projected to triple in Japan by 2034. MHI is capacity-constrained, not demand-constrained, with plans to double gas turbine production capacity within two years. Japanese defense spending is an independent additive catalyst. Unanimous analyst Buy consensus (13 Buy, 0 Sell).

**Critical constraint:** The OTC ticker MHVYF trades as few as 320 shares per day — completely uninvestable. Must be accessed via TSE (7011.T).

**Key risks:** 58x forward P/E for a 7% operating margin industrial. Execution risk on capacity doubling. Decarbonization regulatory headwinds. Project cost escalation risk on 7-10 year gas turbine delivery timelines.

---

### HOLD (TSE Direct): Sumitomo Electric (5802.T) — 4% Allocation

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Forward P/E | 13x | Cheapest in the group |
| EV/EBITDA | 5.8x | Deep value (vs 13-year median of 11.4x) |
| P/S | 1.1x | Deep value |
| Operating Profit Growth | +41.5% YoY | Strong momentum |
| Operating Margin | 7% | Low |
| D/E | 0.29 | Moderate |

**Why HOLD (not BUY):** Easily the cheapest stock on nearly every metric. Operating profit surged +41.5% YoY, and the stock is up ~416% from its 52-week low yet multiples remain compressed because earnings grew faster. However, it is a diversified industrial with low 7% operating margins and indirect AI exposure. The automotive wiring harness business (~40% of revenue) dilutes the AI thesis. Goldman Sachs rates it Buy.

**Critical constraint:** The OTC ticker SMTOY trades as few as 1 share per day — literally untradeable.

---

### AVOID: Resonac Holdings (4004.T / SHWDY) — 0% Allocation

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| D/E | **1.54** | Highest in the group by far |
| Altman Z-Score | **1.37** | **Distress zone** (<1.81) |
| Net Debt | -735B yen | Heavy leverage |
| Operating Margin | 4.6% | Wafer-thin |
| Overall Revenue Growth | ~flat | Legacy chemicals drag |

**Why AVOID:** Despite a genuinely exciting semiconductor materials segment (+40% profit growth, 29% EBITDA margin), the overall business is hobbled by a deeply leveraged balance sheet (D/E 1.54, Altman Z in distress territory) and deteriorating legacy chemicals. The semiconductor segment alone cannot carry the company. The stock is up 293% from its 52-week low, pricing in considerable optimism about the AI materials pivot. In a downturn, the debt burden becomes the dominant concern. This is a high-risk turnaround play unsuitable for a balanced portfolio.

**OTC untradeable:** SHWDY trades approximately 185 shares per day.

## III. Portfolio Construction

### Allocation by Theme

| Theme | Tickers | Allocation | Rationale |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Semiconductor Equipment** | ATEYY, TOELY, HOCPY, DSCSY, LSRCY | 50% | Highest direct AI exposure and best OTC liquidity. Contains the strongest moats. Cap at 50% to manage the NVIDIA correlation trap. |
| **Power & Energy Infrastructure** | HTHIY, 7011.T, 5802.T | 27% | Most important diversifier. Grid modernization, transformer, and turbine demand operate on fundamentally different timelines than semiconductor capex. |
| **Materials & Packaging** | SHECY, 4062.T | 17% | Mid-supply-chain with different cycle timing. Shin-Etsu's fortress balance sheet anchors the materials allocation. |
| **Cash Reserve** | — | 6% | Dry powder for pullback opportunities in DSCSY, LSRCY, or ATEYY |

### ADR Liquidity Management

| Tier | Approach | Names |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Tier 1 (tradeable)** | Standard market or limit orders | TOELY, ATEYY, HTHIY |
| **Tier 2 (marginal)** | **Limit orders only**, multi-day position building | SHECY, DSCSY, HOCPY, LSRCY |
| **Tier 3 (untradeable)** | **TSE direct** via Interactive Brokers or similar, or substitute with Global X Japan Semiconductor ETF (2644.T) | MHVYF, SMTOY, SHWDY, IBIDF |

### Five Governing Principles

1. **Cap semiconductor equipment at 50% maximum.** The equipment cluster moves as a single unit with 0.7-0.93 correlation to NVIDIA. Holding 5 equipment names does NOT provide meaningful diversification.

2. **Hitachi is the single most important diversifier.** It is the only Tier 1 liquid OTC name outside semiconductor equipment, and its power grid business operates on a fundamentally different demand cycle.

3. **Use limit orders exclusively for Tier 2 names.** Market orders on thinly traded OTC ADRs will result in significant adverse price impact.

4. **Monitor hyperscaler quarterly capex guidance.** Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta forward capex guidance is the single best real-time signal for the entire portfolio thesis. Any sequential decline should trigger immediate review.

5. **Consider 30-50% JPY currency hedge.** Unhedged yen investments have cost US investors 3.5-6.5% annually over the past 15 years. The yen is approximately 70% undervalued on PPP, and BOJ rate normalization supports gradual yen strengthening. A partial hedge balances near-term depreciation risk against long-term PPP reversion.

## IV. Risk Matrix

| Rank | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| 1 | OTC ADR illiquidity (MHVYF, SMTOY, SHWDY, IBIDF) | CERTAIN | HIGH | Use TSE direct access or ETF substitution |
| 2 | High intra-portfolio correlation (equipment cluster) | HIGH | HIGH | Cap equipment at 50%, anchor with Hitachi |
| 3 | China export control escalation | HIGH | HIGH | TOELY (42% China sales) most exposed. Diversify across power/materials |
| 4 | AI capex deceleration / monetization failure | MEDIUM | SEVERE | Monitor hyperscaler guidance; maintain 6% cash for de-risking |
| 5 | JPY/USD currency risk | HIGH | MEDIUM | 30-50% hedge via DXJ/HEWJ ETF or FX forwards |
| 6 | Semiconductor cycle peak timing | MEDIUM | HIGH | Stocks historically peak before revenue peaks. Mid-cycle currently. |
| 7 | Valuation compression (ATEYY 44x, DSCSY 45x) | MEDIUM | MEDIUM-HIGH | Position size discipline; buy on pullbacks |
| 8 | NVIDIA single-customer concentration | MEDIUM | HIGH | Affects ATEYY, TOELY, DSCSY, Ibiden |

## V. Semiconductor Cycle Positioning

Based on SEMI December 2025 forecasts:

| Metric | 2025 (Est.) | 2026 (Forecast) | 2027 (Forecast) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Total Equipment Sales | $133B (+13.7%) | $145B (+9.0%) | $156B (+7.6%) |
| Test Equipment | $11.2B (+48%) | $12.5B (+12%) | $13.4B (+7.1%) |
| DRAM Equipment | $22.5B (+15.4%) | $25.9B (+15.1%) | $27.9B (+7.8%) |

**Assessment: MID-CYCLE with sustained growth but decelerating momentum.** Growth rates are moderating from the explosive 2024-2025 AI-driven surge but remain solidly positive. We are past early-cycle acceleration but NOT yet in late-cycle overcapacity. Americas equipment spending is forecast to jump 56.4% in 2026 (CHIPS Act buildouts).

**Critical caveat:** Semiconductor equipment stock prices historically peak in market value BEFORE industry revenue peaks. Position sizing should reflect this asymmetry.

| Resonac (TSE) | 12x | 14.3x | 2.3 | 1.54 | -735B | 75 | **AVOID** |

*Lasertec: Forward P/E on trough earnings; cyclically-adjusted P/E is approximately 30-40x*

---

## VII. Implementation Checklist

1. Open international brokerage account with TSE access (Interactive Brokers recommended) if not already available
2. Build Tier 1 OTC positions first: HTHIY, ATEYY, TOELY (market or limit orders)
3. Build Tier 2 OTC positions with strict limit orders over multiple days: SHECY, HOCPY, DSCSY, LSRCY
4. Build TSE direct positions: 7011.T (MHI), 4062.T (Ibiden), 5802.T (Sumitomo Electric)
5. Implement 30-50% JPY currency hedge via DXJ/HEWJ ETF or FX forwards
6. Set calendar reminder: review portfolio after each hyperscaler earnings cycle (quarterly)
7. Set alert: if NVIDIA or TSMC guide capex lower sequentially, reduce equipment allocation by 10-15%

---

## VIII. What We Would Change on a Pullback

If semiconductor equipment stocks correct 20%+ from current levels:

- Upgrade TOELY from HOLD to BUY, increase to 15%
- Upgrade DSCSY from HOLD to BUY, increase to 8%
- Increase ATEYY to 18%
- Consider adding Resonac if D/E improves below 1.0x
