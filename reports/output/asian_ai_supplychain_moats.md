# KEY INVESTMENT THEMES

## 1. The Japanese Photoresist Oligopoly
JSR, TOK, Shin-Etsu, and Fujifilm collectively control ~90% of the global photoresist market. Japan weaponized this position in 2019 with export controls on South Korea. This is a recognized strategic chokepoint.

## 2. The ABF Substrate Bottleneck
Ajinomoto's monopoly on ABF material means the entire substrate supply chain depends on a single company's capacity expansion plans. This has been a recurring bottleneck.

## 3. HBM Memory Shortage
SK Hynix, Samsung, and Micron are the only three companies that can make HBM. SK Hynix leads with ~50%+ share. HBM production capacity directly limits AI GPU shipments.

## 4. Advanced Packaging = New Bottleneck
CoWoS (TSMC), HBM stacking (SK Hynix), and FC-BGA substrates (Ibiden/Shinko/Unimicron) are all capacity-constrained. Equipment makers (Disco for grinding, Hanmi for TCB, TEL for deposition) all benefit.

## 5. EUV Supply Chain is Entirely Japan + Netherlands
ASML (lithography), TEL (coater/developer), Lasertec (mask inspection), and the Japanese photoresist makers form a closed ecosystem. No country outside Japan + Netherlands can replicate this.

## 6. Data Center Power & Cooling
As AI power consumption explodes, Delta Electronics (power), Nidec (cooling), Fujikura/Furukawa/Sumitomo Electric (optical interconnects) are critical infrastructure plays.
